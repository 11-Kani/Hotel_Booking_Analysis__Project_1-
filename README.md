Procedure:-
Here in we are dealing with Hotel_Booking_Analysis on to which factors booking,cancellation,profits are decided.
When we  briefly analyze the data sheet we observe some columns with  null values which are  taken care of.We also remove duplicate rows,then we move next target hat is outliers [the exceptional value for particular column which are not relevant for data sheet].Now that our data sheet is void of null values, outliers we can proceed with analysis.
We observe sheet contains data for two types of hotelsïƒ City Hotel & Resort Hotel.We would create a dataframe  subset of each hotel so that we can analyze there inputs separately.

Our observations:
1.For Hotel :-
City Hotel shares 61% out of 100 than Resort Hotel.BB stands for Bed and Breakfast. And 78% of people prefer 'BB' type meal. 'A' is the most preferred room type reserved by guests. . Most of guests visting fall under  Transient Type[it can be individual or group who make booking prior 1-2 days of arrival and their stay length vary from 1-2 days]. Only 8% guests require parking spaces.

2.Bookings and Cancellation:-
Bookings for City hotels are higher than Resort hotels over the years and in year 2016 the bookings for both the hotels were maximum. Most bookings were done in the month of May- August. Most guests visited the hotels where from Portugal and other Europian contries.So we need to advertize more in order countries to gather guests from all over the globe. Only 4% of guests are repeated. This shows industry should encourage honest feedback provided by guest and should create changes  the packages plans and should improvise their  services.Mainly a pair of adults vists the hotel mostly than the family with children. So we can think more of attractive packages for family of 4-5 in offer to increase their engagements. City hotels have more number of stays irrespective of week or weekend stays.

We observed rate of cancellation is higher in City hotel.In year 2015 rate of cancellation was  low. As expected , Most Bookings are done with 'No deposit' and most cancellations are also in 'no deposit' bookings. It is a surprise to see cancellations with 'Non-refundable' bookings. City hotel has significantly longer waiting time, hence City Hotel is much busier than Resort Hotel.

3.Average_daily_Rate:-
We observed: For resort hotels, the average daily rate is more expensive during August- September.For city hotels, the average daily rate is more expensive from May-August .Prices of resort hotel are much higher. Prices of city hotel do not fluctuate that much.

4.Observatin from corelation:
1-->Full_stay length and lead time have slight correlation. This may means that for longer hotel stays people generally plan little before the the actual arrival.2--> Average_daily_rate is slightly correlated with Total_members, which makes sense as more no. of people means more revenue, therefore more Average_daily_rate.
